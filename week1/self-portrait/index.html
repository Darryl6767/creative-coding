    In this assignment, I wanted to take 3 pictures that really encapuslated me as an artist and have that be the 3 pictures in my slides. I wanted to have them eqidistance to each other and for me to do that, I used some code from W3 schools on How to Align Images Side By Side. Once I had that, I added a footer to the bottom with the bio that I currently use on my Spotify account. I didn't want any crazy vibrant color, as all the pictures varied in color. That was my main inspriration for my project!

       <b> Considering the multitude of talented artists trying to make a name for themselves, everyday via social media, it’s important to recognize this artistic saturation, hone your craft, and understand what you can bring to the table. This is exactly what Loudoun County, Virginia, native rapper SH1NOB1 is looking to do everyday.

Since the beginning of his career in 2018, he’s strived — and, might, I add succeeded — to deliver a fully realized, unique, and impressively whole sound, one track after the other. From his first two albums, Out with the Old, In with the New, and Twilight, to his most recent single, “FIGURE IT OUT(OUT LOUD)”, there are clear signs of musical and lyrical progress, with the latter showing how far he’s come as an artist.
